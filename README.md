# Dotfiles

This repository holds all of the personal configuration that I enjoy for
devlopment and command line usage. If you are searching for helpful default
settings or otherwise, feel free to borrow/steal my settings.

I have learned to prefer these settings over time. I strongly suggest trying
some of the settings incrementally before just copying them. It is always good
advice to only use settings that you understand what they do, not just because
someone suggested them.
